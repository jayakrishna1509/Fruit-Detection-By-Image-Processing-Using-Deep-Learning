# Improved-Fruit-Detection-By-Image-Processing-Using-Deep-Learning

MINI WORKING PROJECT

Our Aim is to Deep Learning techniques such that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) models test the frameworks and validate the dataset through training and testing fruit images to get ripe or damaged quality of the freshness of the fruit.

## Potential improvements:-
Since very little was known about fruit detection when this study was initiated.

Throughout the construction process, we acquired knowledge regarding the enhancement capabilities.

We can broaden some of our focus to improve our efficiency.

• Interactive with a better model

• Manage the prediction results

• Add and loaded the dataset

• Making the flexible in grading results

• Cost-effective
